##### This Repository contains files for the course of Data Science and Machine Learning at PUC-RS

These files are relevant for Daniel Favero's Final Course material work 

The TCC report can be found as a word document named: Ethics on Tech - Explainable AI towards to a more Humane World.docx

The Python Notebooks used for the analysis is split into 3

- In a first stage, data cleaning is done with 1_data_cleaning_v3.ipynb
- Second stage, Model creation is done with 2_model_creation_v2.ipynb
- Model Analysis is done via 3_model_analysis_v2.ipynb

To replicate these results one needs to:
1- Download HMDA data from: https://s3.amazonaws.com/cfpb-hmda-public/prod/snapshot-data/2021/2021_public_lar_csv.zip
- Note that this is a 1.4GB file

2- Create folders as identified in the read_csv command lines

3- In case one wants to skip the  Data cleaning and model creation steps, download the models from my OneDrive, files can be loaded directly into 3_model_analysis:
